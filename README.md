Final Sprint Project

Team 3: Leon Chisholm, Lyndon Loveys, John O'Neill

This is a web application that authenticates and logs in a user who can then make GET requests to two databases (one is a MySQL db, the other is a PostgreSQL db).
User credentials are stored in one of the databases.
The frontend is written in React JS.
The REST API is written in Java using the Spring Boot framework.

For the purpose of the assignment, the two databases set up as two RDS instances on AWS.
The application itself has been Dockerized, and the container runs on an AWS EC2 instance.
